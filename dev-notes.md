## Dev Notes

## Audio 
- Research into how to use the HTML audio file.
- Each sound will have to be its own audio tag
- Must make the sounds loop when selected

- Considering a 'music mixer' based off of a pipe organ.
- Added some organ tracks for example, made by me (Gavyn).

## JS 
- Research into how drag and drop works in js
- Drag and drop will be used on the various sounds to add it into the mixer

## CSS
- CSS will be used to style the website and make it have the correct design
- The grid system will be used to make sure the website is responsive

- A little animation of the pipe organ design could involve 'steam' blowing out of pipes while music is played.

## Design

- Adding onto the pipe organ design, a concept involves basing it off of how pipe organ's are portrayed in fiction, often being scaled enough to reach the height of a room, and to blast steam and sound while played.
